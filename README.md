# Website Portfolio 

This was created for myself to display a portfolio of my resume, as well as to explore HTML and CSS. There are running instructions below, however, I also have a link to the site in the section below.

## Website
(Link to site via HOSTINGER)
https://alexandradeathportfoliowebsite.com

## Technology Used
- EmailJS
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion 

The website is built using React and Vite, providing a fast and efficient development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules. TailwindCSS is used for styling for a responsive and modern design. Framer Motion is used for animations, adding to the interactivity of the website. EmailJS is used for handling email services, ensuring smooth communication with visitors.

### React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
